# General Style Rules

## Always Auto-Format

Always use auto-formatting on every file type possible.
Defer to rules on auto-formatting for exact coding style in each language.

## Use of Emojis

These rules apply to output and other messages, comments, log messages, user messages,
and UI messages.

- **Use of emojis:**

  - **Do not use emojis gratuitously:** Use emojis in output only if it enhances the
    clarity and can be done with a consistent semantic vocabulary.

  - DO use ✅ and ❌ (or if the codebase already uses them, ✔︎ and ✘) to indicate success
    and failure and ⚠️ and ‼️ (or if the codebase already uses them, ∆ and ‼︎)
    user-facing warnings and errors.
    Whatever you use, just be sure to do it consistently across the codebase.

  - You MAY use the following emojis if you use them consistently:

    - 📈 for reports and quantitative summaries

    - ⏰ for timings and scheduling

    - 🧪 for tests and experiments

  - DO NOT use emojis in comments or output just because they are fun or cute.
    Unless the user says otherwise, avoid emojis and Unicode in comments as it adds
    distraction without the benefit of systematic meaning.
