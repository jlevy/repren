Shortcut: New Implementation Spec Doc

Instructions:

1. Make sure it’s clear what plan spec will be used for this implementation.
   The user should provide it and you should find it in @docs/project/specs/active/ with
   a plan- prefix (e.g., plan-YYYY-MM-DD-*.md).
   If isn’t clear, stop and ask!

2. Copy @docs/project/specs/template-implementation-spec.md to
   @docs/project/specs/active/impl-YYYY-MM-DD-feature-some-description.md (filling in
   the date and the appropriate description of the feature, matching the Plan Spec
   filename stem, replacing plan- with impl-)

3. If the plan spec has implementation details, move those details from the plan spec
   into the new implementation spec.

4. Using all the context you now have, fill in the new implementation spec, step by
   step, reviewing existing code carefully as you go.
   Always double-check all referenced code fits with the spec code you write.

5. Summarize what you have done and ask the user to review and if you should begin
   implementation.
