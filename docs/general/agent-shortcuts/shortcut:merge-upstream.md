Shortcut: Merge Upstream Changes to This Branch

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Be sure to check current branch you are on and git fetch --all to get all commits on
   all branches (if any changes are uncommitted ask the user if you should commit)

2. Check all upstream changes to origin/main

3. Check all local changes on this branch compared to the common ancestor on origin/main
   branch

4. Evaluate if there are any likely logical or structural conflicts to be addressed

5. Do a merge of origin/main into the current branch, resolving all conflicts carefully
   with the context fully in mind.

6. Be sure the merge is complete and run full formatting, linting, and tests.
   Fix all issues. Be sure the result is committed.
