Shortcut: New Implementation Beads from Spec

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Make sure it’s clear what plan spec will be used for this implementation.
   The user should provide it and you should find it in @docs/project/specs/active/ with
   a plan- prefix (e.g., plan-YYYY-MM-DD-*.md).
   If isn’t clear, stop and ask!

2. Create a new top-level bead for this work, referencing the spec.
   Reference any other related specs or docs too.

3. Then using all the context you now have, begin to plan the implementation step by
   step, step by step, reviewing existing code carefully as you go and creating beads.
   Always double-check all referenced code fits with the spec code you write.
   Be sure to track dependencies between beads correctly.

4. Summarize what you have done and ask the user to review and if you should begin
   implementation.
