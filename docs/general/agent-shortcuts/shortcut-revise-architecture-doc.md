Shortcut: Revise Architecture Document

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Read the given architecture document

2. Read all code referenced in the document

3. Review all other related code to the topic, doing a systematic review to see what
   parts of the architecture document are correct and current and identifying any gaps
   or inaccuracies or areas it is out of date

4. Do additional web searches on any related information, in particular:

   - Best practices

   - Latest docs on the libraries or frameworks mentioned

5. Revise the architecture document to ensure it is accurate and complete, reflecting
   the current state of the codebase and architecture.
   Preserve the structure and style as closely as possible but revise all needed
   portions.

6. At the end include a “Future Considerations” section with the following subsections:

   - “Open Questions”: List any possible bugs, issues, or areas of uncertainty around
     the design
