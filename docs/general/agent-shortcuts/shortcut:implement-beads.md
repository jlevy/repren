Shortcut: Implement Spec

Instructions:

1. Review @docs/general/agent-rules/ for relevant rules relevant to implementing this
   spec and @docs/general/agent-guidelines/general-tdd-guidelines.md to understand all
   project and testing rules.

2. IMPORTANT: *Track all work with beads.* See docs/general/agent-setup/beads-setup.md
   if `bd` is not set up yet.

3. Implement beads specified by the user, highest priority first.
   If the user did not specify which beads, check all open beads.
   Beads are usually linked to specs so be sure to find specs that are relevant (for
   that bead or an umbrella bead) for each if possible and review those specs.
   Follow all rules and workflows and follow @shortcut:precommit-process.md to commit
   code and commit or sync beads changes after each bead.

4. Repeat this for all beads where you know how to fix them.
   If unsure about a bead let the user know at the end of all work which beads had
   issues.
