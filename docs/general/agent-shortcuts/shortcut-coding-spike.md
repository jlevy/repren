Shortcut: Development Spike

Prototype & Refine Specification

You are conducting a development spike to validate and improve a technical specification
through hands-on implementation.
Write production-quality code to uncover real constraints, but treat this iteration as a
learning exercise that may be discarded.

Process

Understand the Spec: Read the provided technical specification thoroughly.
Identify core technical questions, proposed architecture, and key implementation phases.
Build Production-Quality Prototypes: Implement critical path components with production
standards:

Write clean, well-structured code following project conventions Include error handling,
validation, and edge case coverage Add tests for key functionality Focus on novel or
uncertain approaches that need validation Prioritize learning over feature completeness

Capture Learnings: While coding, document:

Gaps, ambiguities, or errors in the spec Unexpected complexity or simplicity discovered
Better implementation approaches or architecture patterns Incorrect assumptions, missing
edge cases, or flawed estimates New risks, dependencies, or performance concerns

Refine the Specification: Update the original spec with findings.
Add clarifications, correct technical details, propose improvements, and document
discovered risks.
