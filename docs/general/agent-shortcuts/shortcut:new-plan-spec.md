Shortcut: New Plan Spec

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Review @docs/project/specs/active/ to see the list of recent feature specs, feature
   plans, and implementation spec docs.

2. Copy @docs/project/specs/template-plan-spec.md to
   @docs/project/specs/active/plan-YYYY-MM-DD-feature-some-description.md (filling in
   the date and an appropriate description of the feature)

3. Begin to fill in the new feature plan doc based on the user’s instructions, stopping
   and asking for clarifications as soon as you need them.

   Rules:

   - You may break work into a few phases (phases) if it helps with incremental testing.
     But **use as few phases as possible.** If it is straightforward, use one phase.

   - NEVER GIVE TIME FRAMES IN PLANS, like “4-6 hours” or “1 week”.
     Work will be done in one day.
