Shortcut: Implement Spec

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Review the spec (if spec is unclear ask for clarification on which spec to use).

2. Review @docs/general/agent-rules/ for relevant rules relevant to implementing this
   spec and @docs/general/agent-guidelines/general-tdd-guidelines.md to understand all
   project and testing rules.

3. IMPORTANT: *Track all work with beads.* See docs/general/agent-setup/beads-setup.md
   if `bd` is not set up yet.
   Check if beads exist for the spec already.
   If not, create them according to
   @docs/general/agent-shortcuts/shortcut-new-implementation-beads.md

4. Make as much progress as possible, one phase at a time, following all rules and TDD
   workflows, and following @shortcut-precommit-process.md at each phase.

5. At the end of each phase when all is passing checks and reviewed make sure code is
   committed and pushed (and passes commit and push gates) and then move to the next
   phase.
