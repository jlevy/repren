Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Review this spec and help ensure it makes sense, then review the code and help fill
   it in in enough detail you can begin working on it.
   Confirm the spec with the user before you begin.

2. Be sure to review the code to identify any possible issues or ambiguities in the spec
   or in what approach is the simplest and most flexible.

version of the documentation

3. Make the concise and redundant parts of the spec.
   Look for areas of duplication and parts that reference previous version.
