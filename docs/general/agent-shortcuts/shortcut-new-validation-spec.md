Shortcut: New Validation Spec

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Make sure it’s clear what Plan Spec and Implementation docs are being validated.
   The user should provide them and you should find them in @docs/project/specs/active/
   with plan- and impl- prefixes (e.g., plan-YYYY-MM-DD-*.md and impl-YYYY-MM-DD-*.md).
   If isn’t clear, stop and ask!

2. Copy @docs/project/specs/template-validation-spec.md to
   @docs/project/specs/active/valid-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md (filling in the date and
   description to match the Plan Spec filename stem, replacing plan- with valid-)

3. Fill in the template covering everything the user should validate manually.
   Do not repeat things validated by automated tests.

4. Summarize what you have done and ask the user to review.
